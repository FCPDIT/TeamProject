General things

3. Should all the output messages in the Scroll panes be spruced up a bit. At times they are bunched and limited spacing??
4. More test classes.


///==========================
Sales Tab


	Edit Invoices Panel
1. If you click the 'Find Invoice by Id' button, set the the 'Find Invoice by Customer' DROPDOWN to 'select' and visa versa. - 
	Now changed
	
	I have changed the name of the edit invoice tab to pay invoices as this is what it is for now. With regards to points 2 and 3, I believe the pay by customer function is for a customer to clear their account in one click? Where as the function to view all invoices for a customer would be in the view invoices tab. What do you think?

2. Does the 'Find Invoice by customer' only show unpaid invoices?? Should it not show all invoice by that Customer??
3. Is there any point in having the 'Pay All Invoice' button when you view Invoices by a particular user?? Would you ever need that functionality in real life??



///==========================
Orders Tab
	
	Create New Order Panel
1. If I create or delete a new/old Supplier the 'Supplier ID' Dropdown doesnt include the new supplier or delete the removed Supplier ID.
2. If I create or delete an new/old Order the 'Product ID' Dropdown doesnt include the new product or delete the removed Product ID.

	View Orders Panel
1. If I create or delete a supplier the Dropdown doesnt include the new/old supplier

3. Clear panel should reset all the drop down menus back to 'select' if they are displaying info that isnt 'select'.

	Edit Orders Panel
1. If you click 'Find Order by Id' set the the 'Find Order by Supplier' DROPDOWN to select and visa versa.
2. I dont think there should be a 'Recieve All Orders' button, in real life why would you have that??
3. In the text area of 'Unrecieved Orders' more spacing between the orders is needed. They are all being displayed in one block of text.
4. Are we not getting rid of the 'Update Order' button and 'Delete Order' button like we did in Invoice??
5. The total text box is editable??



///==========================
Product Management Tab

	Create new Product Panel
1. Shouldn't 'Supplier id' be a dropdown list? If you enter a supplier ID that doesnt exist what happens??
2. At the minute if you create a product with an exisiting 'Product ID' its allowed. This should be unique.
3. If you enter a word into 'Product ID' it accepts and allows a product to be created, it which it shouldnt, only numbers are allowed.
4. When you click 'Create New Product' the text fields should all be reset to blank.

	View Product Details Panel 
1. Looks good

	Edit Product Details Panels
1. Supplier ID should be a dropdown




///==========================
Profit and Loss Tab 

	Profit and Loss Table Panel
1. Looks good



///==========================
Customer Management Tab
	
	Create New Cutomer Panel
1. When you enter a word into 'Enter Customer Phone', it accepts it. Only numbers should be accepted

	View Customer Details Panel
1. When you click 'View All Customer button' the text area scroll bar starts at the bottom rather than the top. See the .setCaretPosition(0) method
2. If you click 'View By Id' it should set the 'Find Customer by Name' dropdown to select and visa versa.

	Edit Customer Details
1. If you update a customers details and  click 'Update Customer Details' you get a pop up box saying 'Customer Id should be a number' after the confirmation box.
2. Customer Telephone should only take numbers not words.






///==========================
Supplier Management Tab

Same as Customer Management Tab above. 
The new layouts look good.





///==========================
Manage Employee Access
	
	Create  employee Panel
1. The error messages could be a bit clearer of mistakes. For example if you enter a letter into the 'Emplyoee ID' text box you get a message saying
	'Please complete all fields'
